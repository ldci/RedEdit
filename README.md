# Code Editor for Red
### http://www.red-lang.org
This basic multi file editor for Red is a slightly improved version of an old code I wrote at the beginning of Red story :)

This editor is written with Rebol and thus could be re-written with Red/gui. 

Mainly tested witn OSX and Windows.

Of course, you can edit, compile, and run Red and Red/Sytem programs. 

##New Version 2.0

03/25/2016

Compiler options are improved!

Binaries for OSX, Linux and Window are included in /binaries directory

A new sample in /samples directory

Tested with Red 0.54 

## Help required!
Under development. Please feel free to contribute!
