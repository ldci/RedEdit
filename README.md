# Code Editor for Red
### http://www.red-lang.org
This basic multi file editor for Red is an slightly improved version of an old code I wrote at the beginning of Red story :)

This editor is written with Rebol and thus could be re-written with Red/gui. (Mainly tested witn OSX).

Of course you can edit, compile and run Red and Red/Sytem programs.
