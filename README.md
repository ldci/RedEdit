# Code Editor for Red
### http://www.red-lang.org
This basic multi file editor for Red is a slightly improved version of an old code I wrote at the beginning of Red story :)

This editor is written with Rebol and thus could be re-written with Red/gui. 

Mainly tested witn OSX and Windows.

Of course, you can edit, compile, and run Red and Red/Sytem programs.
